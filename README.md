# Prompt 5: Critical Computation

> The best way to understand how a text works, I argue, is to change it: to play around with it, to intervene in it in some way...

> Rob Pope, _Textual Intervention_

> Language makes three-quarters of your writing decisions for you. Not only to the letters observe preferred frequencies, they keep preferred company...The most common digram in English is "he"; you will find it three times in the sentence you are reading now.

## Summary

This week's readings put some of the linguistic playfulness we've explored this semester into sharp relief. Bertram's _Travesty Generator_, as Zach Whalen writes in his critical engagement with the book,

> in naming her book after travesty generator is to raise the stakes in computer-generated poetry. Whereas for Kenner and O'Rourke, labeling their work a "travesty" is a hyperbolic tease, a literary burlesque, for Bertram, the word is reinvigorated with a feeling of its political reality.

The feeling one gets from much of the experimentation we've read and completed so far this semester is one of somewhat light-hearted whimsy. Even the way that Kenner and O'Rourke talk about their own algorithm maintains a level of cultural hobbyism. This week, we engage with texts in ways that will push the envelope of _what computation does_.

## Goals

* Elaborate our understanding of code as an expressive medium by supplementing it with code as a _critical_ medium
* Examine ways to use code as a critical device, uncovering and foregrounding the experiences hidden in language
* Begin an engagement with conceptual practice; that is, developing larger-order concepts and using code to achieve them
* Practice approaching works with a critical lens that describes code and its creations

## Outcomes

* a critical text work which is:
  * applied on a source text
  * the product of an algorithm that has a critical relationship to the source text
  * titled; the title must be included in the `text.md` file
* a short 500 word (minimum) essay which reflects on the relationship of algorithm and product
  * this essay should also incorporate at least one of the readings we've used this week (not including _Travesty Generator_)

### Critical text work

_Procedural note: place code in either `main.py` or `main.js`; output should go in [writing/text.md](writing/text.md)_

Your goal is to find an available source text and write an algorithm modeled on relationships that you discover in it. This may employ work we've already done this semester, or it may forge new paths into the frameworks we've been browsing. We will work on developing our critical view during our lab.

#### Using `p5.js`

If using `p5.js` to complete your work, provide the link (in `Share` mode) below.

### Essay

_Procedural note: complete the essay in [writing/essay.md](writing/essay.md)_

This short essay should combine descriptions of code, output, and source to arrive at a cohesive argument that links all three of those layers. Zach Whalen's exploration of _Travesty Generator_ is a great example of an approach to understanding source, process, and outcome. This is especially true as much of Bertram's source is obscured for various reason (check out the comments on Whalen's article; the author weighs in on this.)

You should cite (by hyperlink) any sources you use and/or quotes you take from our texts this week. In your citations be sure to list titles and authors. This is probably easiest done by using Markdown to change the link text.
